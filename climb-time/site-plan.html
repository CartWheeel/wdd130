        Getting Started</br>
        Top-Rope</br>  
        A style in climbing where a climber is tied in to a harness with a rope that extends and passes up
        through an anchor system at the top of the climb. The rope trails back down to a belayer at the foot of the climb. 
        The belayer takes in slack rope throughout the climb, so that if at any point the climber were to fall,
        they would not fall more than a short distance. It is easy to enjoy indoor and outdoor and what most people think of
        in regards to rock climbing.</br>
        Boulder</br>
        A form of free climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.
         While bouldering can be done without any equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, 
        chalk to keep their hands dry and to provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls.
         Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the sequence of moves 
         that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20 ft.) tall.
          Also easy to enjoy indoor as well as outdoor.</br>
        Traditional</br>
        a style of rock climbing in which the climber places all the necessary protection gear required 
        to arrest any falls as they are climbing, and then removes it when the pitch is complete (often
        done by the second/follow-on climber). Traditional bolted aid climbing means the bolts were placed
        while on lead and/or with hand drills (the bolts tend to be much farther apart than for sport climbs).
        Traditional climbing carries a higher level of risk than bolted sport climbing, as the climber
        may not have placed the safety equipment correctly while trying to ascend the route; for some
         of the world's hardest climbs (e.g. Realization/Biographie), there may not be sufficient cracks
        or features in the rock that can accept protection gear, and the climb can only be safely attempted
       by bolting as a sport climb.
        Sport</br>
        a form of rock climbing that relies on permanent anchors (or bolts), permanently fixed into the 
        rock for climber protection, in which a rope that is attached to the climber is clipped into the
         anchors to arrest a fall; it can also involve climbing short distances with a crash pad underneath
          as protection. This is in contrast to traditional climbing where climbers must place removable
           protection as they climb. Sport climbing usually involves lead climbing and toproping techniques, 
           but free solo and deep-water solo (i.e. no protection) climbing on sport routes is also sometimes possible.

      <h3>Terms</h3>
      <p>
Anchor—A point of attachment for a climbing rope, usually made with slings, runners or the rope itself. May be top-rope anchors, belay anchors or a protection piece mid-climb.
Barn door—To swing sideways out from the rock due to being off balance. Often occurs with a lie-back maneuver.
Belay—To keep a climber from falling too far by using friction on the rope. The system that stops a climber's fall. It includes the rope, anchors, belay device and the belayer.
Belayer—The person who manages the rope so as to catch the climber on the other end in case of a fall or a slip.
Beta—Information about a climb. "Running beta" is information given while the climb is being executed.
Bolts—Metal expansion bolts drilled into the rock for use as protection on sport or aid climbs. Hangers are attached to the bolts for clipping in your rope.
Bouldering—Climbing close to the ground without the use of a rope. Typically used for practicing traverses, weight transfers, and foot and hand placements. Can be done on boulders or at the base of a rock face. 
Camming device—A piece of climbing protection that wedges into a crack or pocket by rotating. Can be a passive cam or a spring-loaded device with two or more camming pieces on a stem.
Carabiner—Metal loop (usually aluminum) with a spring-loaded gate on one side used for connecting various parts of a climbing system. May be oval, pear- or D-shaped. Also "karabiner" or "krab". (Don't use "biner" though, because it's offensive to many people of Mexican descent.)
Climber—Anyone who participates in the sport of climbing. Also refers to the person moving (as opposed to the belayer).
Crag—A small cliff, or the term for a climbing area.
Crux—The toughest move or sequence of moves on a climb.
Dynamic—Climbing rope that elongates or stretches to absorb the impact of a fall. Opposite of static. Also, a climbing move in which the climber lunges or leaps to the next hold. Also called a "dyno move".
Face—The relatively smooth portion of a cliff. A face climb typically requires friction and various handholds, whereas a crack climb uses more counter-force and jamming techniques.
Figure 8—Climbing knot woven in the shape of the number 8, typically used for tying the climbing rope to the climber's harness. Also, the name of a belay/rappel device with the same shape.
Flash—A red point ascent (first try on lead) utilizing prior inspection, information or beta from others.
Free solo—Climbing without a belay, which is usually very high risk. Unlike bouldering, free soloing goes far above the ground on full-length routes.
Grigri—The first popular belay device with an auto-locking mechanism to catch a climber's fall. Made by Petzl.
Mantel—A climbing move in which downward pressure is applied with the hands to a ledge, lifting the body high enough to get the feet on that same ledge. Usually used when no handholds are available.
 Multi-pitch—A climb longer than one rope length. See pitch.
 Pitch—The length of a climb that can be protected by 1 rope length. A pitch is led by the lead climber and cleaned by the second (or follower). See multi-pitch.
Pumped—To be weakened or in pain (usually in the forearms) from a strenuous move or climb.
Rack—The selection of gear used for a climb. Also refers to a sling full of this gear.
 Rappel—To descend a cliff or other height by lowering oneself on a fixed rope, with feet against the wall. Friction is placed on the rope, usually with a belay device, to keep the descent slow and controlled. See free rappel.
Red point—To lead a climb without falling or putting weight on the rope, regardless of number of attempts. Applies to difficult climbs.
Route—The path or moves up a specific climb.
Smear—Climbing technique in which the sole of the shoe, plus proper weight over the feet, provides traction for moving upward.
Solo—To climb alone without protection.
Static—Limited movement or stretch, when referring to a climbing rope. Static ropes are used for rescue, caving and rappelling, but do not stretch enough to absorb the impact of a leader fall when climbing. Opposite of dynamic.
Stemming—Technique in which the hands and/or feet are pressed in opposition far out to each side, as in a dihedral or wide chimney.
Top rope—A rope that is passed through a fixed anchor at the top of a climbing wall or cliff, with each end tied to the climber and the belayer at the bottom. A top rope (with a watchful belayer) ensures that the climber is always protected from falling very far, and is thus a good way to learn to climb. "Top-roping" is the term for this type of climbing.
Traditional or "trad"—Rock climbing using protection placed by the lead climber and removed by the second, as opposed to sport climbing, in which protection (bolts) is pre-placed. See sport climbing.
Undercling—A climbing move in which counter-pressure is applied to the underside of a rock flake or slab by pulling up on it, while pushing down on the feet.
Webbing—Woven nylon tape used for making slings and runners for climbing.
Whipper—A long fall.
