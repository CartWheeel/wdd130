            <h3>Top Rope Climbing</h3>
            <p>A style in climbing where a climber is tied in to a harness with a rope that extends and passes up through an anchor system at the top of the climb. The rope trails back down to a belayer at the foot of the climb. The belayer takes in slack rope throughout the climb, so that if at any point the climber were to fall, they would not fall more than a short distance. It is easy to enjoy indoor and outdoor and what most people think of in regards to rock climbing.</p>

            <h3>Boulder Climbing</h3>
            <p>A form of free climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.  While bouldering can be done without any equipment, most climbers use climbing shoes to help secure footholds, chalk to keep their hands dry and to provide a firmer grip, and bouldering mats to prevent injuries from falls. Unlike free solo climbing, which is also performed without ropes, bouldering problems (the sequence of moves that a climber performs to complete the climb) are usually less than 6 meters (20 ft.) tall. Also easy to enjoy indoor as well as outdoor.</p>

            <h3>Traditional (Trad) Climbing</h3>
            <p>A style of rock climbing in which the climber places all the necessary protection gear required to arrest any falls as they are climbing, and then removes it when the pitch is complete (often done by the second/follow-on climber). Traditional bolted aid climbing means the bolts were placed while on lead and/or with hand drills (the bolts tend to be much farther apart than for sport climbs). Traditional climbing carries a higher level of risk than bolted sport climbing, as the climber may not have placed the safety equipment correctly while trying to ascend the route; for some of the world's hardest climbs (e.g. Realization/Biographie), there may not be sufficient cracks or features in the rock that can accept protection gear, and the climb can only be safely attempted by bolting as a sport climb.</p>

            <h3>Sport Climbing</h3>
            <p>A form of rock climbing that relies on permanent anchors (or bolts), permanently fixed into the rock for climber protection, in which a rope that is attached to the climber is clipped into the anchors to arrest a fall; it can also involve climbing short distances with a crash pad underneath as protection. This is in contrast to traditional climbing where climbers must place removable protection as they climb. Sport climbing usually involves lead climbing and toproping techniques, but free solo and deep-water solo (i.e. no protection) climbing on sport routes is also sometimes possible.</p>
