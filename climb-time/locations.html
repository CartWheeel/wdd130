            <h3>The Rock Gym, Rexburg</h3>
            <p>The Rock Gym in Rexburg is a great place to start your climbing journey. They have a large variety of grades for all levels of climbers. If you are wanting to get into rock climbing but don't have a community to help you, this is the place to go!</p>

            <h3>The Edge Gym, Idaho Falls</h3>
            <p>Although it is little further than Rexburg, The Edge is a great gym. It is larger than The Rock Gym and provides a larger variety of routes. The gym has been around longer and has a more stable community and so it has grown to accommodate climbers of many types. After you have learned the basics and want to explore more of what climbing has to offer, you should check out The Edge.</p>

            <h3>Ross Park, Pocatello</h3>
            <p>Once you have gotten you body conditioned after a couple months climbing indoors (and when it isn't too cold outside) you are ready to hit the real rock! The Ross Park area has a number of different bouldering routes as well as top ropes. It has nice shady areas and seating room so you can take a group of people to experience the joys of outdoor climbing. The variety in Ross park is great for its size, but when it's busy you run out of room quickly.</p>

            <h3>Moab, Utah</h3>
            <p>When you want some amazing views and a great climb, you should hit up Moab. Moab is in south eastern Utah and is quite the drive, but if you can find the time it is well worth it. Moab has beautiful arches and spires of rock that make for a spectacular view. The rock is really rough so you will need to have your callouses built up and a healthy amount of tape.</p>
