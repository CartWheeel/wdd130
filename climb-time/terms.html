        <h2>Terms To Know</h2>
        <section class="terms">
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Anchor—A point of attachment for a climbing rope, usually made with slings, runners or the rope itself. May be top-rope anchors, belay anchors or a protection piece mid-climb.</li>
                    <li>Approach—The route or walk in to the base of a climb.</li>
                    <li>Barn door—To swing sideways out from the rock due to being off balance. Often occurs with a lie-back maneuver.</li>
                    <li>Belay—To keep a climber from falling too far by using friction on the rope. The system that stops a climber's fall. It includes the rope, anchors, belay device and the belayer.</li>
                    <li>Belayer—The person who manages the rope so as to catch the climber on the other end in case of a fall or a slip.</li>
                    <li>Beta—Information about a climb. "Running beta" is information given while the climb is being executed.</li>
                    <li>Bight—A bend in a rope or a folded section of rope.</li>
                    <li>Big wall—Extended, multi-pitch rock climb that often takes several days to complete.</li>
                    <li>Bolts—Metal expansion bolts drilled into the rock for use as protection on sport or aid climbs. Hangers are attached to the bolts for clipping in your rope.</li>
                    <li>Bouldering—Climbing close to the ground without the use of a rope. Typically used for practicing traverses, weight transfers, and foot and hand placements. Can be done on boulders or at the base of a rock face.</li>
                    <li>Carabiner—Metal loop (usually aluminum) with a spring-loaded gate on one side used for connecting various parts of a climbing system. May be oval, pear- or D-shaped</li>
                    <li>Crag—A small cliff, or the term for a climbing area.</li>
                    <li>Crux—The toughest move or sequence of moves on a climb.</li>
                    <li>Drag—Friction created when a climbing rope passes through multiple pieces of protection, especially if they are not in a straight line up the route. Can pull a lead climber off balance.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic—Climbing rope that elongates or stretches to absorb the impact of a fall. Opposite of static. Also, a climbing move in which the climber lunges or leaps to the next hold. Also called a "dyno move".</li>
                    <li>Figure 8—Climbing knot woven in the shape of the number 8, typically used for tying the climbing rope to the climber's harness. Also, the name of a belay/rappel device with the same shape.</li>
                    <li>Flash—A red point ascent (first try on lead) utilizing prior inspection, information or beta from others.</li>
                    <li>Free solo—Climbing without a belay, which is usually very high risk. Unlike bouldering, free soloing goes far above the ground on full-length routes.</li>
                    <li>Grigri—The first popular belay device with an auto-locking mechanism to catch a climber's fall. Made by Petzl.</li>
                    <li>Jug—Large, easily gripped hold. Also, to climb up a fixed rope using an ascender.</li>
                    <li>Lead—To be the first person on a climb, either clipping the rope into bolts or placing protection as you go. Belayed by the second, below you.</li>
                    <li>Lie-back—Climbing technique that uses counter-pressure of hands pulling and feet pushing, typically to climb an offset crack or a flake. The term "lie-back refers" to the body position of leaning backwards and to one side with arms straight and feet shuffling up the wall.</li>
                    <li>Mantel—A climbing move in which downward pressure is applied with the hands to a ledge, lifting the body high enough to get the feet on that same ledge. Usually used when no handholds are available.</li>
                    <li>Multi-pitch—A climb longer than one rope length</li>
                    <li>Pitch—The length of a climb that can be protected by 1 rope length. A pitch is led by the lead climber and cleaned by the second (or follower).</li>
                    <li>Pumped—To be weakened or in pain (usually in the forearms) from a strenuous move or climb.</li>
                    <li>Quickdraw—A short runner used to attach a rope to a bolted anchor with carabiners.</li>
                    <li>Rack—The selection of gear used for a climb. Also refers to a sling full of this gear.</li>
                    <li>Red point—To lead a climb without falling or putting weight on the rope, regardless of number of attempts. Applies to difficult climbs.</li>
                    <li>Route—The path or moves up a specific climb.</li>
                    <li>Smear—Climbing technique in which the sole of the shoe, plus proper weight over the feet, provides traction for moving upward.</li>
                    <li>Static—Limited movement or stretch, when referring to a climbing rope. Static ropes are used for rescue, caving and rappelling, but do not stretch enough to absorb the impact of a leader fall when climbing. Opposite of dynamic.</li>
                    <li>Undercling—A climbing move in which counter-pressure is applied to the underside of a rock flake or slab by pulling up on it, while pushing down on the feet.</li>
                    <li>Webbing—Woven nylon tape used for making slings and runners for climbing.</li>
                    <li>Whipper—A long fall.</li>
                </ul>
